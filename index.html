        <h2>Day 1</h2>
        <article>
            
            <p>On the first day, the Polish students arrived in the Essen city center. After a short greeting, mixed groups were formed, which were tasked to visit various sights located around the city. These groups then experienced a lot during an exciting rally and learned a lot about Essen's history and culture.</p>

            <p>After an eventful first day, we met at the Polish youth hostel in Düsseldorf and then took the coach to the Heinz-Nixdorf Museum in Paderborn. There, we learned a lot about technical inventions from all ages, especially modern technologies, such as computer science and robotics; all thanks to the friendly tour given by Ms Malzahn. We then drove to Dortmund to the Signal Iduna Park, where the football fans could have their photos taken in front of the Borussia Dortmund stadium.</p>

        <h2>Day 3</h2>
        <article>
            
            <p>The first thing we had planned for that day was visiting the "Zache Zollverein" museum. This place was an exhibition of how people lived in the Ruhry area over time and how life evolved there. Then after a fast break we went to the "seaside beach" park to have some fun climbing, playing volleyball and chilling. After the wonderful time we said goodbye to each other and went to our homes. </p>

            <img src="img\pizza.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Today the Poles were able to take part in the day-to-day student life at the Wolfskuhle high school. They were split up into a few groups which attended German, history and computer science classes respectively. After a short welcome and speech by our headmaster Mr. Paus, the Polish and German students reunited, had lunch together, and started work on the team website project.</p>

        <h2>Day 5</h2>
        <article>
            
            <p>The last day of our journey. In the morning we went straight to "Classic Remise", which is the museum of cars located in Dusseldorf. The moment we arrived we handed each other small gifts to commemorate the time we spent together. After admiring the exhibits - which ranged from 60’s era racing machines to modern luxury sports cars - we thanked each other for the unforgettable week and said our last goodbyes. After that, the Polish group went to their bus and headed home.</p>
